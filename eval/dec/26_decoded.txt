research aimed at finding a substitute for soil-based composts -LRB- such as the John Innes ' mixes , which were running into difficulties even then because of the shortage of loam of the required type and quality -RRB- .
 Fisons started seed and potting compost research in 1956 when it moved to Levington , near Ipswich , Suffolk .

 top layer of a fertile meadow cut and stacked for at least a year .

 use of these products would reduce the pressure on threatened peat bogs , home to many rare plants , and also help address waste disposal problems .
 Use one part manure to five parts of shredded leaves and grass .
 Take a black -LRB- color is important because it absorbs heat -RRB- plastic bag .
 rodents -RRB- , add a nitrogen product and fill with water -LRB- .
 The 5,000 tons of sludge will be treated with lime and then transferred to a facility that will mix the waste with leaves and sell it as compost , George Balog , the city 's public works director .
 the peat-free , hardy cyclamen and various lilies .
 `` my own garden soil is excellent loam , I add many bags of KRA organic amendment or Bandini soil builder each time I plant .
 The first phase of the process is to extract sludge and remove most of the water and then add this to bark , sawdust and household waste to improve the consistency and increase the proportion of carbon .
