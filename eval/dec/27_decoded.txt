cabinet minister produces the best results for Wales .
 Welsh secretary , has time and again reiterated party policy that a strong Welsh Office .
 Plaid Cymru , debating the issue at its annual conference in Cardiff .
 is pressing for a chamber made up of two MPs - one man and one woman - from each of the 38 constituencies in Wales , plus additional elected members .
 leaders of the Assembly of Welsh Counties said yesterday .
 GOVERNMENT 's plans for reorganising local government in Wales and Scotland should be withdrawn .
 leaders said they would not co-operate with the government over its proposals .
 reorganisation should not be considered until it had agreed to create a directly elected Welsh assembly and Scottish parliament . The CYMRU has said it would seek a guarantee that Wales would be treated as favourably as Scotland on devolution .
 It also wants any Welsh parliament .
 it says should be set up within a year , to have revenue-raising powers . Nationalist Cymru , the Welsh party , launched its manifesto , urging self-government for Wales within the European Community .
 nationalists are a minority force in their own country .
 despite winning a fourth seat at last April 's general election , polling slightly under 10 per cent of the popular vote and trailing not just Labour and the Conservatives but also the Liberal Democrats , this policy is as much dead in the water at the moment as an elected assembly . GOVERNMENT white paper followed more than 18 months of consultation which found support for the principle of unitary authorities .
 The issue was raised in the Commons on Thursday by Mr Alex Salmond , leader of the Scottish National party .
 ` If John Major can tell people of the six counties of Northern Ireland that if it is their wish , democratically expressed , that they can unite with the Irish Republic ... by what token can he deny that self-same degree of sovereignty to the people of Wales and of Scotland ? ' Mr John Redwood has been caused by pressures on the parliamentary timetable for legislation .
 The government proposed that its bill to reform local authorities should become law in the spring .
 party [UNK] appears to be following in the footsteps of Scotland .
